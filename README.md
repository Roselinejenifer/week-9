# Map animation
In map animation we have a marker placed in MIT and travel to Harvard. The marker shows the stops between MIT and Harvard while it moves
#### Steps to Run the Project
Touch the marker to make it travel from MIT to Harvard
#### Future Improvements
This Project can be further enhanced by using pointing the name of the stops and effects to it
